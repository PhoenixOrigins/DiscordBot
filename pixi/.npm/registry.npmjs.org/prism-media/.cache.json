All the features provided have predictable\nabstractions and join together coherently.\n\n```js\n// This example will demux and decode an Opus-containing OGG file, and then write it to a file.\nconst prism = require('prism-media');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.createReadStream('./audio.ogg')\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.OggDemuxer())\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.Decoder({ rate: 48000, channels: 2, frameSize: 960 }))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./audio.pcm'));\n```\n\nThe example above can work with either a native or pure JavaScript Opus decoder - you don't need to worry about changing\nyour code for whichever you install.\n\n- FFmpeg support (either through npm modules or a normal installation) \n- Opus support (native or pure JavaScript)\n- Demuxing for WebM/OGG files (no modules required!)\n- Volume Altering (no modules required!)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe following dependencies are all optional, and you should only install one from each category (the first listed in\neach category is preferred)\n\n- Opus\n  - [`node-opus`](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-opus) (native, ^0.3.1)\n  - [`opusscript`](https://github.com/abalabahaha/opusscript) (^0.0.6)\n- FFmpeg\n  - [`ffmpeg-static`](http://npmjs.com/ffmpeg-binaries) (^2.4.0)\n  - [`ffmpeg-binaries`](http://npmjs.com/ffmpeg-binaries) (^4.0.0)\n  - `ffmpeg` from a [normal installation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)\n\n## Useful Links\n\n- [Documentation](https://hydrabolt.me/prism-media)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/amishshah/prism-media/tree/master/examples)\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/discordjs)\n\n## License\n\n> Copyright 2019 Amish Shah\n> \n> Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n> you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n> You may obtain a copy of the License at\n> \n>    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n> \n> Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n> distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n> WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n> See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n> limitations under the License.","maintainers":[{"name":"hydrabolt","email":"amishshah.2k@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2019-04-28T16:34:09.445Z","created":"2017-04-15T18:32:51.307Z","0.0.1":"2017-04-15T18:32:51.307Z","0.0.2":"2017-10-22T14:44:12.728Z","0.1.0":"2018-01-21T17:42:21.553Z","0.2.0":"2018-03-05T19:28:52.683Z","0.2.1":"2018-03-30T14:08:33.189Z","0.3.0":"2018-06-20T19:41:33.104Z","0.3.1":"2018-06-22T18:09:00.914Z","0.0.3":"2018-08-07T19:29:43.456Z","0.4.0":"2019-02-17T20:36:07.236Z","0.4.1":"2019-02-17T20:38:43.304Z","0.4.2":"2019-02-17T21:45:55.807Z","1.0.0":"2019-02-21T11:50:04.343Z","1.0.1":"2019-02-22T14:59:04.171Z","1.0.2":"2019-04-28T16:34:06.789Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hydrabolt/prism-media#readme","keywords":["audio","media","ffmpeg","opus","pcm","webm","ogg"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/hydrabolt/prism-media.git"},"author":{"name":"Amish Shah","email":"amishshah.2k@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hydrabolt/prism-media/issues"},"license":"Apache-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"hintss":true},"_etag":"W/\"4c296e2a1141c43bfa8a13bd0ba185ba\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 16:34:10 GMT"}
